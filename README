This software is a very simple listening proxy server.  Intended to have
minimal external dependancies and be compilable on Windows with open
source compilers (At the time of writing, this was the LCC compiler)

In 1998, accessing the internet from a corporate network was often a much more
convoluted technical setup than later.  The environment that this was written
for was using the Microsoft Proxy Server to shim Winsock library calls and
tunnel all internet access to the Server.  This made it hard for non Windows
operating systems to access the internet (as they have no Winsock, let alone
the custom binary version of winsock that was needed for this special tunnel).
The (hacky) solution was to run this proxy program on a Windows machine and
use that as a static port proxy for the Unix systems.
